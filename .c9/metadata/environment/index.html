For the first 2 years, students will learn communication skills, business skills, financial education, basic accounting, and life-prep skills. After the first two years, students will study for a career while only attending school 3 days per week, allowing time for work/interning.</p>\n            <p>• Enrollees over 18 who have not gone through the first two years of business, finance, and communications coursework will go through an accelerated process while studying their career.</p>\n            <p> • All Wisconsinite's are eligible. If a student does not have a tax payer identification number, Future Schools will provide students a path to legal citizenship. Critical Race Theory will not be taught as Future Schools will provide education focused on results, careers, and financial education.</p>\n            <p>• Consider This: Instead of guessing what businesses need, businesses of all sizes will work with our Future Schools to educate our teachers, enabling our teachers more pay. Then, teachers will educate our students in skills that fit their choice, so that students graduate debt free, with a financial-and-wealth-building background, and ready for a career. Traditional Universities will still be an option, however Future School enrollees will NOT be required to take SAT/ACT testing for placement at State Schools.</p>\n          </article>\n          <hr style=\"width: 1px; border: none; background-color: black;\">\n          <article id=\"content\">\n            <h3>4.

Liability, insurance, and bonding is required by virtue of licensure, so let licenses mean something, and get the government out the way, subject to audits and oversight.

The problem? The Governor is in the way. Cities and counties don’t want traffic; it hurts them. As Governor, Levi will request public proposals from private companies who will compete against each other for opportunities to fix our transportation nightmare. This might include logical changes to speed limits, lane efficiency, and enhancements to our building processes that enable faster solutions, such as multiple private partnerships providing tunnels throughout the same, where traffic is worst.</p>\n          </article>\n          <hr style=\"width: 1px; border: none; background-color: black;\">\n          <article id=\"content\">\n            <h3>6.

Wisconsin has over 23,000 prisoner's and spends over $30,000 per prisoner per year on housing Prisoners. This is backwards.

Our “illegal” immigration crisis is a result of a HORRIBLE, out-dated, and criminalizing immigration disaster. A 14-day legal immigration process helps us attract not just refugees, but also qualified immigrants who can support and contribute to our economy. Legal immigration does not cost Wisconsin jobs, it expands our economy and grows our revenues. Consider this: A CPA who moves to Wisconsin from Brazil, who agrees not to accept any social-welfare programs, needs a dentist, doctor, grocery store, taxi driver, retail stores, and more. For each person who legally immigrants to Wisconsin, we expect economic growth for 10+ Wisconsinite's.</p>\n            <p>• Every mid to low income Immigrant will need to have a job lined up. They will get a temporary 2 year Citizenship and will have to attend a future school on the side to learn English etc. If they still have a job and no criminal activities they will be granted full Citizenship.</p>\n            <p>Additionally and on Manufacturing:</p>\n            <p>• Wisconsin will also partner with companies providing access to Future Schools.</p>\n            <p>• This allows companies to train students prior to graduating Future Schools, making them career ready at 18.</p>\n          </article>\n        </section>\n        <a name=\"9.
